-This Folder contains a python file, which is a simple tic tac toe game on a 3x3 grid.
-When the tic-tac-toe file runs the user is asked if they want to play against an AI, they can answer either "True " or "False"
-If they types "False" the game begins with two users playing, each taking turn.
-If user types "True", they get to pick between the first player, Player1(if they type "1"), and the second player, Player2(if they type "2")
-The player declares the position of his point on the grid by first entering the row position(0,1,2) and then the column position(0,1,2)
-The game switches between the two players and stops when one player wins or when there is a draw.
-The result of the game is printed out along with the final version of the playing board.
